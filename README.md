# Blockchain and Stock Market Data Analysis

This project analyzes blockchain and stock market data using various big data technologies including Hadoop, Hive, Pig, and Spark.

## Project Overview

The pipeline includes:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Implemented using direct file transfer, Flume for stream ingestion, and Sqoop for database imports.
   
2. **Data Storage**: Utilized HDFS and Hive for data storage and organization.
   
3. **Data Analysis**: Employed multiple analytical approaches:
   - **Pig** for data transformation and analysis.
   - **Hive** for SQL-like querying.
   - **Spark Core** for distributed data processing.
   - **Spark SQL** for structured data analysis.

Key analyses include:
- **Blockchain Metrics**: Total blocks, block heights, transaction counts.
- **Stock Market Indicators**: Price ranges, highest/lowest prices per symbol, trading volume analysis.

## Technologies

- **Hadoop**
- **Hive**
- **Pig**
- **Flume**
